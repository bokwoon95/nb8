www.nbrew.io nuances
- only serves stuff in {sitePrefix}/output/themes
- if requested URL is a HTML page, issue a permanent redirect to that site's URL instead
- this is to prevent the same page from being available on multiple sources e.g. www.nbrew.io/@bokwoon and bokwoon.nbrew.io
- cdn.nbrew.io behaves identically to www.nbrew.io except cdn.nbrew.io may use a DNS CNAME record to point it to an actual CDN URL. If no CDN service is set up, cdn.nbrew.io gracefully degrades to serving files identical to www.nbrew.io.
